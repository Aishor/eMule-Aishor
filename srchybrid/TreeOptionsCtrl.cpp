/*
Module : TreeOptionsCtrl.cpp
Purpose: Implementation for an MFC class to implement a tree options control
		 similar to the advanced tab as seen on the "Internet options" dialog in
		 Internet Explorer 4 and later

Created: PJN / 31-03-1999
History: PJN / 21-04-1999 Added full support for enabling / disabling all the item types
		 PJN / 05-10-1999 Made class more self contained by internally managing the image list
		 PJN / 07-10-1999 1. Added support for including combo boxes as well as edit boxes into the
						  edit control.
						  2. Added support for customizing the image list to use
		 PJN / 29-02-2000 Removed a VC 6 level 4 warning
		 PJN / 03-04-2000 Added support for navigation into and out of the combo boxes and edit controls
						  inside the control
		 PJN / 10-05-2000 1. Fixed a bug where the text was not being transferred to the control when the
						  in in-place combo or edit box is active and the tree control gets destroyed.
						  2. Added support for having check box items as children of other check box items
						  3. Setting the check box state of a parent now also sets the check box state
						  for all child box children.
						  4. Setting the check box state affects the check box state of the parent if that
						  parent is also a check box.
		 PJN / 30-05-2000 Code now uses ON_NOTIFY_REFLECT_EX instead of ON_NOTIFY_REFLECT. This allows
						  derived classes to handle the reflected messages also.
		 PJN / 03-07-2000 Now includes support for edit boxes with accompanying spin controls
		 PJN / 25-04-2001 1. Creation of the image list is now virtual. This allows customisation such as
						  being able to use high color bitmaps
						  2. Added an option which determines if check box state should be changed when you
						  click anywhere on an item or just over the checkbox icon
						  3. Updated copyright message
		 PJN / 12-08-2001 1. Fixed an issue in GetComboText and GetEditText where the code was modifying the
						  contents of the combo/edit box when it was being read. This was because that
						  function is doing double duty as it is called when the child control is about to be
						  created in place, and you want to remove the text from the tree control and put it
						  in the child control. Thanks to "Jef" for spotting this.
						  2. Made the code in SetComboText more robust. Thanks to "Jef" for this also.
						  3. Added a DDX method for integers in an edit box. Thanks to Colin Urquhart for this.
						  4. Added an extra member to CTreeOptionsItemData to be used as an item data. This
						  allows you to avoid having to implement multiple derived classes and instead use
						  the item data's I now provide to stash away pointers etc.
		 PJN / 27-08-2001 1. Provided a "GetUserItemData" member to provide access to the item data provided
						  by the class. Thanks to Colin Urquhart for this.
						  2. Fixed a redraw problem which occurred when you scrolled using a wheel enabled
						  mouse. Thanks to "Jef" for spotting this.
						  3. Provided an AutoSelect option which automatically sets focus to child control
						  in the tree control. Thanks to "Jef" for this suggestion.
						  4. Added full support for CBS_DROPDOWN and CBS_SIMPLE style combo boxes. Thanks
						  to "Jef" for this suggestion.
		 PJN / 16-08-2001 1. Provided support for specify a color via CColorDialog.
						  2. Controls are now created to fill the full width of the tree control
						  3. Provided support for specifying a font via CFontDialog
						  4. Provided support for specifying a font name from a combo box
						  5. Provided support for specifying a boolean value from a combo box
		 PJN / 27-11-2001 1. Fixed a bug where the message map for OnMouseWheel was setup incorrectly. It
						  should have been ON_WM_MOUSEWHEEL instead of ON_MESSAGE!!!.
						  2. Allowed passing in the hAfter item for the InsertItem calls. All params are defaulted
						  as to not affect any current code.
						  3. Made possible the use of radio button groups followed by other items (in which case
						  the group is considered complete).
						  4. Added a couple of utility functions at the bottom of the cpp file. Thanks to Mike
						  Funduc for all these updates.
		 PJN / 05-11-2001 1. Minor code tidy up following development of the author's CTreeOptionsCtrl class
		 PJN / 13-12-2001 1. Fixed an assertion in OnClick. Thanks to "flipposwitch" for spotting the problem
		 PJN / 14-02-2002 1. Now allows item data to be associated with any item added to the control
						  2. Fixed issue with return value from GetUserItemData
		 PJN / 02-06-2002 1. Moved sample app to VC 6 to facilitate support for IP Address control and date and
						  time controls.
						  2. Fixed a bug where the child controls can get orphaned when a node in the tree
						  control is expanded or contracted. Thanks to Lauri Ott for spotting this problem.
						  3. Now fully supports the CDateTimeCtrl for editing of dates and times
						  4. Now fully supports the CIPAddressCtrl for editing of IP addresses
						  5. Custom draw support for color browser items is now configurable via an additional
						  parameter of the AddColorBrowser method
		 PJN / 24-09-2002 1. Updated documentation which incorrectly stated that the parent of a check box item
						  must be a group item as inserted with InsertGroup. Thanks to Kögl Christoph for
						  spotting this.
						  2. Fixed an issue with "IMPLEMENT_DYNAMIC(CDateTimeCtrl..." not being declared properly.
						  Some users reported that it worked OK, while others said that my fix was causing link
						  problems. The problem should be sorted out for good now. Thanks to Kögl Christoph for
						  reporting this.
						  3. Renamed the SetImageListToUse function to "SetImageListResourceIDToUse".
						  4. Provided a GetImageListResourceIDToUse function to match up with the Set function.
						  5. Provided a method to allow the user item data to be changed after an item has
						  been created.
						  6. Provided some documentation info how to safely use item data in the control.
						  Thanks to Kögl Christoph for reporting this.
						  7. Fixed a potential memory leak in AddComboBox if the function is invoked twice without
						  an explicit delete of the item first. Thanks to Kögl Christoph for reporting this.
						  8. Fixed some typos in the documentation. It incorrectly stated that the return type of
						  member functions InsertGroup, InsertCheckBox, and InsertRadioButton is BOOL when in fact
						  it is HTREEITEM.  Thanks to Kögl Christoph for reporting this.
						  9. Improved the look of the disabled checked check button. Thanks to Kögl Christoph for
						  reporting this.
						  10. Improved the look of the disabled radio button which is selected. Thanks to Kögl
						  Christoph for reporting this.
		 PJN / 17-10-2002 1. Added a method to add an "Opaque Browser" to the Tree options control. An
						  Opaque Browser is where the tree options control allows an end user specified
						  structure to be edited by the tree options control without it explicitly
						  knowing what it is editing.
		 PJN / 25-10-2002 1. Updated the download to include the missing files OpaqueShow.cpp/h. Thanks to Kögl
						  Christoph for reporting this.
						  2. Made the class more const-correct. e.g. the Get... member functions are now const.
						  Thanks to Kögl Christoph for reporting this. Also updated the documentation for this.
						  3. Updated the documentation to refer to the "Opaque Browser" support.
		 PJN / 28-10-2002 1. Fixed a bug where upon a combo losing focus it will also result in the associated
						  button control would also be destroyed. Thanks to Kögl Christoph for reporting this
						  problem. Fixed this bug should also fix an intermittent release bug which was occurring
						  in this area.
		 PJN / 30-10-2002 1. Made a number of other methods const. Thanks to Kögl Christoph for reporting this.
		 PJN / 15-11-2002 1. Now allows the Field Data separator i.e. ": " to be configured. Please note that the
						  characters you pick should be avoided in the descriptive text you display for an item
						  as it is used as the divider between the descriptive text and the actual data to be
						  edited. Thanks to Kögl Christoph for this update.
						  2. Fixed an access violation in CTreeOptionsCtrl::OnSelchanged when there is no selected
						  item in the control. Thanks to Kögl Christoph for this update.
		 PJN / 06-03-2003 1. Fixed a memory leak which can occur when the control is used in a property sheet.
						  Thanks to David Rainey for reporting this problem.
						  2. Fixed another memory leak in the destructor of the CTreeOptionsCtrl class when the
						  test app is closed
		 PJN / 14-05-2003 1. Fixed a bug where the OnSelChanged function was getting in the way when the control was
						  being cleared down, leading to an ASSERT. Thanks to Chen Fu for reporting this problem.
		 PJN / 07-06-2003 1. Fixed a bug where the date time control was not reflecting the changes when the child
						  control was displayed. Thanks to Tom Serface for reporting this problem.
		 PJN / 17-07-2003 1. Made SetRadioButton methods in CTreeOptionsCtrl virtual to allow further client
						  customisation.
		 PJN / 26-07-2003 1. Fix an issue where the child controls get drawn in the wrong place, if the item is just
						  on the vertical (either top or bottom) edge of the client area. Thanks to Kögl Christoph
						  for reporting this problem and providing the fix.
		 PJN / 31-07-2003 1. Now class does not require the use of the built in image list. This means that now the class
						  behaves like its parent class CTreeCtrl in that management of the image list is entirely
						  outside of the class and client code calls SetImageList as per normal.
						  2. Class now draws the radio and check box icons using custom draw.
						  3. Class now takes advantage of XP Visual Themes when available.
						  4. Made a number of additional functions virtual to allow more types of client customisation
		 PJN / 02-08-2003 1. Now supports multi-line edit controls as a child control
		 PJN / 18-09-2003 1. Fixed a bug when the control draws the custom draw icons when the control does not have
						  an image list attached. Thanks to Benoit Lariviere for reporting this problem.
						  2. Fixed a bug where the control draws the custom draw icons in the wrong position when
						  the control has horizontal scroll bars. Thanks to Benoit Lariviere for reporting this problem.
		 PJN / 11-12-2003 1. Implemented the function SetUseThemes which was missing. Thanks to Marcel Scherpenisse
						  for reporting this problem. Also updated the sample app to enable toggling of this setting.
						  2. Improved the default look of radio buttons and check boxes when the control is not
						  XP themed. This is achieved using the virtual function GetItemIconPosition. Thanks to Marcel
						  Scherpenisse for reporting this issue. This update also means that by default radio buttons
						  and check boxes are by default draw as 16*16 icons centred in the icon position for each
						  item. This can of course by overridden by derived classes.
		 PJN / 05-02-2004 1. Made HandleChildControlLosingFocus public so that it can be called from outside the class. This
						  is useful in the following scenario reported by RnySmile: I noticed a bug happened only if it is
						  used in a Property Page. I added an Edit item, and when user leaves that item with a child
						  control active while tabbing away to another tab, the data of that item will lost. The solution
						  is to ensure HandleChildControlLosingFocus is called before a DDX_Tree... function is called
						  if a child control is active.
		 PJN / 05-05-2004 1. Fixed some compiler warnings when the code is compiled using VC 7.x. Please
						  note that to implement these fixes, the code will now require the Platform SDK
						  to be installed if you compile the code on VC 6.
		 PJN / 26-01-2005 1. Both of the sample apps shipped with the class now include XP manifest files, meaning that the
						  full look and feel of XP Themes are shown. Thanks to Piotr Zagawa for reporting this issue.
		 PJN / 16-03-2005 1. Fix for crash when you have one of the edit controls in a IP address control selected and
						  you then select another item in the tree options control. Hard to know if this is a bug in the
						  control on in Windows itself. Either way, the workaround fix is to ensure that the child windows
						  of an IP Address control are destroyed before we destroy the IP address control itself. Thanks
						  to Steve Hayes for reporting this problem.
		 PJN / 11-07-2006 1.  Updated copyright details
						  2.  Removed unused constructor and destructor methods from some of the classes in the sample app.
						  3.  Replaced calls to ZeroMemory with memset
						  4.  Addition of CTREEOPTIONSCTRL_EXT_CLASS macro to allow the code to be easily added to an
						  extension dll.
						  5.  Class now uses private messages based at WM_USER instead of WM_APP
						  6.  Optimized CTreeOptionsCtrl constructor code.
						  7.  Optimized CTreeOptionsCombo constructor code.
						  8.  Optimized CTreeOptionsDateCtrl constructor code
						  9.  Reworked CTreeOptionsDateCtrl::GetDisplayText logic
						  10. Reworked CTreeOptionsTimeCtrl::GetDisplayText logic
						  11. Optimized CTreeOptionsIPAddressCtrl constructor code
						  12. Optimized CTreeOptionsEdit constructor code
						  13. Optimized CTreeOptionsSpinCtrl constructor code
						  14. Optimized CTreeOptionsBrowseButton constructor code
						  15. Replaced calls to CopyMemory with memcpy
						  16. Optimized CMultiLineEditFrameWnd constructor code
						  17. Removed common control 6 manifest as this conflicts with VC 2005 compilation.
						  18. Updated the code to clean compile on VC 2005.
						  19. Updated documentation to use the same style as the web site.
		 PJN / 23-12-2007 1. Updated copyright details.
						  2. Removed VC 6 style AppWizard comments from the code.
						  3. Optimized CTreeOptionsItemData constructor code
						  4. Boolean member variables of CTreeOptionsItemData have now been made "bool" instead of "BOOL".
						  5. Fixed an issue where if you create a combo box with a style of CBS_DROPDOWN instead of
						  CBS_DROPDOWNLIST, then the combo box would not be properly deactivated when it loses focus to a
						  control outside of the TreeOptionsCtrl while the cursor is in the combo box edit field. Thanks
						  to Tobias Wolf for reporting this issue.
						  6. Fixed a crash where you select a combo box item, select something in it and then hit tab.
						  7. Focus is now correctly transferred to a tree options button if you hit tab on a tree options
						  combo box.
						  8. GetBrowseForFolderCaption, GetBrowseForFileCaption and GetFileExtensionFilter all now by
						  default use a string resource.
		 PJN / 21-06-2008 1. Updated copyright details
						  2. Code now compiles cleanly using Code Analysis (/analyze)
						  3. Updated code to compile correctly using _ATL_CSTRING_EXPLICIT_CONSTRUCTORS define
						  4. The code now only supports VC 2005 or later.
						  5. Replaced all calls to CopyMemory with memcpy
						  6. Fixed a bug in the CTreeOptionsCtrl constructor when checking the validity of the function
						  pointers for XP Theming.
						  7. Fixed a bug in the sample app's COpaqueShoeButton2::BrowseForOpaque function
		 PJN / 20-07-2008 1. Added two missing files to the download zip file specifically the correct sln and vcproj
						  files. Thanks to Ingmar Koecher for reporting this issue.
						  2. Radio buttons and check boxes now by default use a more 3d style of drawing when XP theming
						  is not active. You can revert back to a more flat style of drawing these items by
						  SetFlatStyleRadioButtons(TRUE) and SetFlatStyleCheckBoxes(TRUE) respectively. Thanks to
						  Ingmar Koecher for reporting this issue.
		 PJN / 29-04-2012 1. Updated copyright details.
						  2. Updated sample project settings to more modern defaults
						  3. Code now compiles cleanly using Code Analysis (/analyze)
						  4. When the parent node of a group of checkboxes is also a checkbox (e.g. the Node "Security"
						  in the test app) the parent is checked / unchecked depending on the status of its children
						  whenever a child is modified in the GUI. This previously worked ok when you changed the
						  checkmark of a child in the GUI by mouse or keyboard, but it doesn't work if the change is
						  made programmatically (via SetCheckBox or by means of the referenced boolean variable). The
						  code has now been updated to handle this anomaly. Thanks to Michael Oerder for providing this
						  nice update.
		 PJN / 21-05-2012 1. Updated the code to draw disabled items in gray text. Thanks to Damir Valiulin for this
						  nice addition.
		 PJN / 16-03-2015 1. Updated copright details.
						  2. Updated the code to clean compile on VC 2013
						  3. Code no longer uses LoadLibrary without an absolute path when loading XP Theming DLL. This
						  avoids DLL planting security issues.
